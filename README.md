# Food Delivery App using MERN Stack

The purpose of this project is to develop a food delivery app using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The app allows users to order food items. The app is designed to be user-friendly, with a clean and modern interface.
## Tech-Stack

- Cart screen
- Login and Logout screen
- Admin screen

### Home Screen
- Displays the list of food items.
- Includes a search bar and number of items to be ordered options.

- Allows the user to place an order.

### Order Screen
- Displays the details of the user's order.

### Admin Screen
- Displays the management interface for menus and orders.

## Design
The design of the app is modern and user-friendly, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The app uses a clean and minimalist design, with a black background and simple typography. The app also uses clear and concise language, with straightforward labels and instructions.

### Steps to Run the App

#### Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

#### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about running tests for more information.

##### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

##### `npm run eject`
**Note:** this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it
